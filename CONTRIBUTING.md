How to contribute?
------------------

Technology
-----------

We use C# (tested on Windows, not Mono) with OpenCV (for .NET).


Issues
------

To get started, there is all kinds of indentation issues in the codebase, fix
those so you can get a feel for how all the code is laid out.

Documentation
-------------
There is a need for more documentation, especially on how to get a SixthSense device
working. Most of our documentation currently resides on the Github wiki, which is a good
place to contribute.

Standards
---------

We use tabs-as-spaces, with 4 spaces for identation. There is all kinds of
identation issues, and we encourage people to fix those.


Android
-------

We are working on an Android port, but, it is nowhere near complete. We will
have more details ready once we have developed some of the UI.

Ports
-----

The current code only runs on Windows, under the CLR virtual machine (i.e. C#).

Java (Linux, Mac OS X, Android, etc.)

If you are working on a porting SixthSense to a different environment
(*nix, Mac OS X, Android, etc.) please list it here, with some kind of link to
code.
